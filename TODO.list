1) Problems of "convert"
  a) remove "sudo" right.
  b) cannot solve disorder in the original SNAP file. 
      Only supports soc, twitter and ydata. Needs to support more real-world graphs.
  c) no progress bar. 
      Users don't know where they are.
  d) More flexible weight value input. 
      Should support the weight column or other input methods.
  e) Objective: more flexible, more adaptable

2) More example algorithms
  a) SCC, Triangle counting, MSF.
      Key problem is how to optimize (achieve reasonable runtime for real large graph). challenge!
      Study how to combine data-parallel exec. model to task exec. model.
      Study how to alter CSR/CSC data format at high efficiency.
  b) Some other types?

3) The Engine
  a) Better debugging and further analyzing
      Should record the resource utilization rates during the sub-iteration/iterations.
      Study further directions of optimizations.
  b) Faster convergence
      Use the up-to-date value (in the attribute buffer) to further decrease iteration numbers.
      Study the pros. (smaller iteration numbers) and the cons. (overhead by memory visiting)
  c) Better programmability
      Absorb vertex-centric programming model in FOG? real challenge!
